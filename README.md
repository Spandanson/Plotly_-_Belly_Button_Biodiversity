# Belly Button Biodiversity
## 1. Background:
* Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. 
* She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. 
* Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons
* If Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is 
  found in their navel. 

## Obsevation and Results:
### The results are found in the form of follow charts:
